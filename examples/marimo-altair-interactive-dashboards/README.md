# Marimo Altair Interactive Dashboards Example

This example demonstrates using multiple playbooks to create a comprehensive technical blog post about building interactive data visualizations.

## Playbooks Used

- [`marimo-notebooks-playbook.md`](../../playbooks/marimo-notebooks-playbook.md) - Reactive notebook development with private variables and widget patterns
- [`altair-interactive-charts-playbook.md`](../../playbooks/altair-interactive-charts-playbook.md) - Declarative interactive visualization with coordinated selections
- [`blog-writing-playbook.md`](../../playbooks/blog-writing-playbook.md) - Technical blog writing structure and best practices

## Initial Prompt Used

```
About Marimo Notebooks using Altair, find and use both playbooks from the `playbooks/` directory
```

## Content Evolution

The blog post underwent a significant prose transformation to address readability concerns:

### Prose Enhancement Prompt

```
Improve the prose, the blog is straightforward but quite dry to read.
```

**Result**: The content was transformed from dry, mechanical technical documentation into an engaging, conversational tutorial with:
- Compelling hooks and excitement-building language
- Metaphorical descriptions ("dashboard choreography," "reactive magic")
- Emotional connections and personality-driven explanations
- Progressive storytelling with smooth transitions

**Note**: While this demonstrates the power of prose enhancement, the transformation went somewhat overboard with enthusiasm and could benefit from dialing back to a more balanced professional tone that maintains engagement without being overly exuberant.

## Output

The resulting blog post is available in [`marimo-altair-interactive-dashboards.md`](marimo-altair-interactive-dashboards.md).

This demonstrates how to combine multiple domain-specific playbooks (Marimo and Altair) with process-specific guidance (blog writing) to create comprehensive educational content that teaches both technologies working together, and how follow-up prompts can refine the prose style (with varying degrees of success).
