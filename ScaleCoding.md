# Scale Coding

This file is meant to hold a concept that engineering teams, from scientific computing advancement to enterprise teams, are using with assisted development, programmatic workflows, software architectural definition and reviews, including AI generated code. 
The Scale code concept is expected to evolve itself inspired on the applied Natural Selection Theory.

## Background

Most Computing patterns, concepts and techniques do not overcome the test of time, as the software engineering and computational science evolve themselves fairly quick compared to most areas, while expanding other knowledge verticals during the process.
Self-evolving concepts, as the software engineering or computer science seems to need concepts that can hold significance throughout the time, being meaningful at the time the reader acknowledges it.
Scale Coding is meant to incorporate patterns that allow top notch teams to performe above the average levareging computer assisted programming and workflow tools. The current validated state-of-art patterns that allow Teams engaged with reliable products, artifacts, assets, computational services to perform their tasks.

## Application

A brief English description of the advantages and use cases.
Maybe some examples.

### Baseline

The main reference to the Scale Coding concept is the man-hour multiplier (refer The Mytical Man-Month). 

There are four levels of multipliers:

1. Junior Professionals - Scale Coding rate is compared to a professional or newgrad with between zero and two years of experience. 
2. Senior Professionals - Scale Coding is comparable and measured against a professional with ten years or more of experience
3. Cross-Department Professionals - This measurement is task or workflow oriented, tangibly compared with cross-domain managers, inter-department or knowledge domain, usually with more than 5 years of experience in each domain.
4. Scientific Exploration Professionals - Coding research, preamble, and development prepared for analysis by a master-equivalent degree.


## Safety Checks

How to avoid deviations or risks in Software Engineering and applied research with evolving Scale Coding.
Assisted programming and scientific research benefits the societies where they are applied to. On the other hand, loose constraints and lack of oversight may result in weak patterns and low value generation with AI assisted coding.

### Generator and Discriminator/Validator

Relevant evolving generative patterns are normaly encapsulated into generator (proposer), applied research (application), and validation/discrimination under a given environment. (GANs references here)
The environment can be understood as a software interface, where the implementation an Evolutionary or a Reinforcement Learning algorithm. (Refer to Evolutionary Theory, Policies under RL here)
The Generator and Discriminator/validator patterns increase the odds of assisted programming, architectural goals or research to be in line with the desired outcome, sufficiently rrepeatable and auditable.  

## Architecture Considerations

Time to develop:  Before and After
Pattern and helper files.
More test coverture, without overwhelming tests. Focus on Integration Tests.

### Preparation and Validation

Top assisted programming and AI agents currently support prompt preparation and some validation. However, the validation against itself on a self-contained architecture or workflow is still not mainstream. 
Successful Scale Coding patterns contain a preparation phase, the planned request, and the validation are prepared beforehand. The validation is usually validated by a human or a team to ensure the expected outcome will be achieved. 
The workflow is dynamically perfectioned, allowed evolution over time.
